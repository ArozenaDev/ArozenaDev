ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm <b>Jose Arozena</b>, a passionate web developer with an <b>HNC in Web Development</b> and a <b>Bachelor's Degree in TEFL</b> (Teaching English as a Foreign Language).

I'm driven by a love for technology, and I'm always eager to explore new tools and frameworks. My interests also span films, TV shows, manga, anime, and martial arts.

On my journey to becoming a full-stack developer, I've gained proficiency in Java, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and more. My goal is to master the full development stack and understand the inner workings of technology.

Currently, I'm honing my skills in ASP.NET Core MVC, React, and Symfony. I'll be sharing my projects here, and I'm excited about the possibility of collaborating on any project where I can make a meaningful contribution.

<b>Cheers!</b>
