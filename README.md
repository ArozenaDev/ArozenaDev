ðŸ‘‹ Hi! My name is <b>Jose Arozena</b>. I have been studying hard to become a developer. I have a <b>Bachellor Degree in TEFL</b> (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) and during
the last two years I have been studying to get a <b>HNC in Web Development</b>, as well as self-taught learning to code. Pandemics had a deep impact on me and I decided to quit on 
my job as a teacher to fulfill my dream to become a developer.

My interests are films, tv shows, manga and anime, martial arts and all things related to technology.

In my path to coding, I'm learning Java, SQL, HTML, CSS, JS, PHP... the aim is to become a full-stack developer with deep understanding of how things work.

I will be uploading my training projects here and I' looking forward to collaborate on every project I have the chance to contribute to.

<b>Cheers</b>!
